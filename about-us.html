              <p class="content-paragraph">
                &emsp;Pacifica started as a small business that took a leap of
                faith. Through the years, we have been able to sucessfully
                create a family of customers and pracitioners. Because of this,
                we hope to inspire each and every one who walks into Pacifica to
                take a leap of faith and do what they've been putting off.

            &emsp;We hope to be more than a service to each and every one of you
            who walks into Pacifica. We hope our massages leave your body and
            mind relaxed, our facials leave you glowing radiantly and feeling
            lively, and our beauty treatments allow you to embrace your
            imperfections and feel beautiful inside and out. But, more than a
            service, we hope to help you feel more relaxed, healthier, and
            happier. By allowing you to feel differently, we believe it will
            allow you to better deal with significant changes and welcome new
            opportunities into your life.

            &emsp;More than just helping you on an individual level, we are also
            glad to welcome you into the Pacifica family. Our goal is to create
            a small community within Pacifica that works to spread positivity
            and happiness inside and outside of our spa. We believe that by
            allowing people to relax and forget their worries, we can make
            change on an individual level that will spread to all those around
            them. Hopefully we can inspire you, build confidence, and induce
            relaxation, which will spread to all areas of life.
