            &emsp;I believe I have met the expectations required for the
            project. To cover the basics, I have eight seperate webpages,
            navigation links, a mobile-friendly site, and it is shared with you
            on GitHub. Below is the requested breakdown and below that is the
            client Critique:

                Hello, <br /><br />
                &emsp;&emsp;I cannot stop raving to all of my business partners
                about the site that Katie Henschell created for us here at
                Pacifica. It looks beautiful, professional and is so intuitive
                to use. So many new customers have flooded in since the site has
                been live. I have to admit, some of our services were rarely
                booked because people were unaware of them. Katie has created
                multiple pages for our various treatments and they are all being
                booked frequently. This intelligent decision has made it so easy
                for our current clients to rebook appointments and new ones to
                understand what Pacifica Spa offers. <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;The aesthetic of the website perfectly fits with our
                spa at Pacifica and just opening to the home page I feel
                relaxed. I love that she put our customers past reviews so
                prominently featured on the home page. People left us glowing
                reviews before but we had no way to share them! Now, just by
                scrolling down, potential customers know that Pacifica Spa is a
                trustworthy brand. <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;Having Pacifica’s hours so visible has made
                scheduling much simpler for customers, especially if they need a
                beauty treatment on their lunch hour! Also, the placement of
                Pacifica’s address has helped new customers to have a much
                easier time locating us. I’ve received so many more
                subscriptions to my newsletter since this site went live and
                have been able to share news and updated services with ease to
                my customers. <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;Katie made our rewards page look so beautiful and
                easy to understand, my customers have all been signing up for
                the program and returning more often now that they know it makes
                a difference in the price! <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;I can see this sight serving me well for years and
                will not hesitate to contact Katie if my business moves or I
                need to add a new service. The site is seamless and even for
                someone like me, who is not that great with technology, I’ve
                found it so straightforward to navigate. The website aesthetic
                is classic, timeless, and the Pacifica Spa has never looked
                better!<br />
                <br />
                Best,<br />
                Mary at Pacifica Spa
